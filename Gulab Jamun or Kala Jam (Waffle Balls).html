        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water,
                and saffron in a saucepan; bring to a boil.<br>
                Reduce heat and simmer until consistency is syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>

            <li>Mix milk powder, flour, and baking soda in a bowl until well-combined.
                Slowly mix in butter and yogurt until dough comes together.<br>
                Let gulab dough rest for 5 minutes. Shape into smooth balls the size of pennies.</li>

            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                Test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a small piece of dough.<br>
                When it sits at the bottom of the pan for 1 minute before coming to the surface,
                the oil is ready.</li>

            <li>Fry 4 gulab balls at a time, stirring carefully,
                until dark golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes.<br>
                Drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining gulab.</li>

            <li>Bring syrup back up to a boil and drop in fried gulab.
                Remove from heat and <br> let them soak in the syrup, covered,
                45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
</ol>
